# trimesh2
This is a fork of the trimesh2 library (originally by [Szymon Rusinkiewicz](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/)), which I use a lot in my other graphics projects. I'm staying close to the original, and adding my fixes for MSVC compilation.

For original project, see [the original Trimesh2 homepage](http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/trimesh2/).

Original MSVC project by Bengt Rosenberger.
